#### Description

Roughly 60,000 titles and abstracts of scholarly articles with the CC-BY redistributable license were downloaded from Elsevier. The articles spanned 10 STEM domains which were the most prolific on Elsevier viz., *Agriculture*, *Astronomy*, *Biology*, *Chemistry*, *Computer Science*, *Earth Science*, *Engineering*, *Material Science*, and *Mathematics*.
The STEM NER system reported in the publication above was applied on these articles. An automatically extracted dataset of 4 typed entities, viz., *Process*, *Method*, *Material*, and *Data* was created.
